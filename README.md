The Weather Application is a simple and effective web-based tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather information using a public weather API. This project demonstrates frontend development skills, API integration, and responsive design.

Objective
The aim of this project is to provide users with a quick and accessible way to get weather updates of any city around the world. Weather affects daily decisions like travel, clothing, and planning outdoor activities. Hence, having a lightweight and easy-to-use application for weather forecasting is practical and helpful.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Used to create the structure and layout of the app.

CSS3: Used for styling the user interface with modern and clean designs.

JavaScript: The core logic is built using vanilla JavaScript for making API calls and updating the UI dynamically.

OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch live weather data based on user input.

Features
City Search: The user can type any city name to get current weather information.

Live Weather Data: Displays temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

Weather Icons: Each weather condition is shown using relevant images (like rain, snow, sun, etc.).

Error Handling: Displays a clear error message if the city is not found or input is invalid.

Responsive Layout: Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

How It Works
The user enters the city name.

JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

The data is fetched, parsed, and displayed using DOM manipulation.

If an error occurs, a user-friendly message is shown.

Challenges Faced
Some challenges included:

Handling asynchronous API requests.

Managing user input errors effectively.

Creating a clean and mobile-friendly design.

Ensuring consistent weather icons for various conditions.

What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:

How to use external APIs and handle their responses.

Real-world use of JavaScriptâ€™s fetch() and async/await.

Error handling in web apps.

Making web pages responsive using Flexbox and media queries.

Using Git and GitHub for version control.

Future Scope
Planned improvements:

Add 5-day weather forecast.

Support for GPS-based location weather.

Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Save previous searches using local storage.

Deploy the app using GitHub Pages.

Conclusion
The Weather App project was an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting. It helped me understand how frontend development and APIs work together. It also strengthened my confidence in web development and problem-solving. With further improvements, this app can become even more user-friendly and informative.
